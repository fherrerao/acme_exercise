## Description
> Exercise Acme is a console application that, given a .txt file with the employees and their respective hours, should return the names of the employees and the number of times they have been in the office.
<hr>

## Solution
> It was built with the `Ruby` language, using the `Singleton` design pattern, a single instance of the Employee class was created. The first step was to create a [Kanban](https://github.com/users/fherrerao/projects/2) board with all tasks needed to complete the project. The solution used was to separate the data of each line to obtain the day, the start time, and the end time of each employee and create an array of objects to iterate it and manage the data obtaining the hours that two employees coincided in the office. 
<hr>

## Built With

- Major languages: Ruby.
- Tools & Methods: RSpec, Rubocop.
<hr>

## Getting Started

We'll need to prepare your computer to handle Ruby an approach you can find in the official [site](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) of Ruby.

<hr>

## Clone Repo

First clone this repo by running this command in your terminal:
~~~ bash
git clone https://github.com/fherrerao/acme_exercise.git
# wait a couple seconds for it to download
# ...
# ...
# then move into the new directory
cd acme_exercise
~~~

<hr>

## Prerequisites

The following technologies must be installed before hand in your local machine:

 - Ruby (ruby --version). Should be 3.1.2 or newer. 

The commands in parenthesis `()` can be used to verify if they are installed and their corresponding versions.

Refer to this [site](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) for more detailed instructions on how to install this technology.

<hr>

## Setup

We're getting there... trust me ;)

## System Dependencies

Execute this command to automatically install all the dependencies needed to view and work on this project:

~~~ bash
bundle install
~~~

The full list of dependencies can be found within the [Gemfile](Gemfile).

This also installs PostgreSQL, which you'll need for the next step.
<hr>

## Usage
If you got to this point, congratulations! You now have spent 2 hours in order to toy with my app. I appreciate your effort :P

## Run Script
Please open a new terminal.

The following command should start the app


~~~ bash
ruby main.rb
~~~

`Note:` Be sure to be in the acme_exercise directory
~~~ bash
cd acme_exercise
~~~
<hr>

## Testing RSpec
If you haven't installed the dependencies yet, please run the following command:

~~~ bash
bundle install
~~~

RSpec tests belong in another folder, which is [/spec](/spec/), all thanks to the ruby **magic** called `naming conventions`.
Anyway, to run tests located in the spec folder run:
~~~ bash
bundle exec rspec spec
~~~
<hr>

## How To Contribute?

Always remember to commit your contributions on a different branch. You can create a new one by running `git checkout -b <branchname>`.

Visit [linters folder](.github/workflows/linters.yml) to learn how to setup linters.

Then check linters locally before pushing by running:
~~~ bash
# ...
# ...
rubocop --color -A
~~~

Finally, once your changes have no linter errors and all tests are passing, try to merge your branch into  `development` by running:
~~~ bash
git checkout development
git merge <branchname>
~~~
Continue by solving any merge conflicts that may arise, test the functionality of the app once more, and you're changes are ready to be pushed with `git push origin <branchname>`
